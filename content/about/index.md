## About Me
Hey, I'm JJ. I have a deep interest in **Information Technology**. In particular, I am passionate about the following domains, many of which are applied in my homelab Git repo (https://github.com/JJGadgets/Biohazard), including but not limited to:

### Information Security (**infosec**)
- Principle of Least Privilege
- Penetration Testing
- Finding and reporting vulnerabilities (e.g. [CVE-2023-43809/GHSA-mc97-99j4-vm2v](../2023/cve-2023-43809))
- System Security, such as OS hardening
- Multi-Factor Authentication with secure methods, such as WebAuthn and hardware security keys
- Encryption in transit & Encryption at rest
- PKI, key management
- Network security, such as firewall rules on gateways and hosts
- Integration with modern developer workflows such as DevOps & Kubernetes
### Networking
- Subnetting and VLANs
- Routing protocols (BGP (iBGP, DN42, eBGP with public ASN), OSPF, OpenFabric, etc)
- VPNs (WireGuard, Tailscale, OpenVPN) and tunnels (VXLAN, Geneve)
### Linux
- Desktop Linux ecosystem (e.g. Wayland, SwayWM)
- Linux command line & configuration
- Immutable systems like NixOS and Talos Linux
### Servers
- Dell PowerEdge
- Supermicro
- Installing and removing hardware and parts such as CPUs, RAM, drives, GPUs, NICs, etc
### Infrastructure side of DevOps
- Kubernetes
- Cloud computing
- CI/CD
- Technologies related to the above.

I enjoy exploring these domains by getting my hands dirty with these technologies in my Homelab, which features networking gear and server hardware, as well as a wide range of deployed software such as Talos Linux and OPNsense.
